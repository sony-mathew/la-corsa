# la-corsa

## Declaration
It's a hobby project. 

## How did I get the idea?
This was born out of a simple idea. When I joined Freshdesk, during the intial phases, I was given some technical tasks to do
as part of the bootcamp to make me familiar with tech stack of Freshdesk. Each of the task was a problem already described 
somewhere in the internet and I was given the urls to each problems(emailed). So as I had this bunch of urls to be followed 
in order to complete the bootcamp, I thought maybe if we had someplace to put these URLs and arrange them and make a 
course out of them and share it with everybody, it would be very nice. The author of the course can add more resources/URLs
later or remove or update existing ones as time goes by. So I thought why not make a app that can do that. And that's how 
la-corsa was born.

## What is this about?
This app is basically a portal where anybody can signup. Any user can create resources. A resource is nothing but a URL 
to some web page and a short description of it. Any number of these resources can be arranged to make up a course. 
This courses can be added tags and categories. Courses will be listed in the portal. Anybody can enroll in these courses 
and also any other user can suggest a course to anybody by their email address. If somebody takes up a course reffered to them
by somebody, then the referrer becomes the mentor and the acceptor becomes the student. Referrers will be able to see 
the progress of their students.
